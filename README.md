# Object Tracker

## 📌 Overview
This project is an **Abandoned Object Detection and Tracking System** that utilizes **OpenCV** and a custom object tracker to detect unattended objects in video feeds. The system helps identify objects that remain stationary for a prolonged period, indicating potential abandonment.

## 🛠 Features
- Real-time abandoned object detection
- Object tracking using a custom tracker
- Bounding box visualization for detected objects
- Adjustable detection parameters for better accuracy
- Video file-based processing

## 🚀 Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Keshav-0502/Abandoned-Object-tracker.git
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required packages:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Tracker
To start detecting abandoned objects, run the script:
```sh
python abandonedObjectDetection.py
```

## 🏗 Tech Stack
- **Python** 🐍
- **OpenCV** 👁️
- **NumPy** 🔢

## 🖥 Usage
- Ensure you have a video file (`video1.avi`) in the same directory as the script.
- The program will detect objects that remain stationary for a prolonged period.
- Press **'q'** to quit the program.

## 🔍 Possible Improvements
Since this project was abandoned, here are some enhancements that could be made:
- **Integration with YOLO or Faster R-CNN** for more accurate detection.
- **Real-time multi-camera support** for broader applications.
- **Adjustable thresholds** for dynamic environments.
